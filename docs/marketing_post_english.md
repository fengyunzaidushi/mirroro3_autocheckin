🧵 **Thread 1/6**  
🚀 Running out of Cursor requests? I found something AMAZING! 

Mirror O3's Claude Code gives you 500+ Sonnet 4 requests DAILY - that's what Cursor Pro gives you in a MONTH! 

Let me break down why this is a game-changer 👇

---

🧵 **Thread 2/6**  
💰 Cost comparison will blow your mind:

Cursor Pro: $20/month → ~500 Sonnet 4 requests  
Mirror O3: $32/month → 24,000-32,000 requests  

That's 30-40x MORE value! Each request costs $0.04 vs $0.001 😱

🧵 **Thread 3/6**  
🔧 Here's the thing - Mirror O3 gives you 1,000 credits instantly + 500 credits per day through manual check-in on their homepage.

That means 16,000 credits/month IF you remember to check in daily... 

But who wants to do that manually? 😅

🛠️ Setup is stupidly simple:

3. Boom! 500 credits every day at 9 AM

The tool handles everything: token refresh, retries, notifications. Set it and forget it! ⚡

🧵 **Thread 6/7**  
📊 Real numbers from my usage:
- 1,000 credits instant + 15,000 from auto check-ins
- = 16,000 credits/month total
- ≈ 28,000 Sonnet 4 requests  
- Total cost: $32
- Cursor equivalent: $1,200+ 🤯

This isn't just savings, it's a paradigm shift!
